    Daily weighted average temperature, humididy and short-wave-length radiation.

    For each city in the cities dataset, we've taken the area defined by its 
    latitude+- 0.2 degrees, and longitude+- 0.2 degrees and for each day computed 
    the mean value for temperature, humidity, and short-wavelength radiation in that area. 
    To produce the daily population-weighted averages for each country, we compute the 
    convex combination of mean local values for each city, where the coefficients are 
    proportional to their population
