# DELVE COVID19 Dataset Access

This repository provides a data set for COVID19 research consolidated from multiple sources.
Code is provided for easily accessing both the combined and underlying data sets.

Usage examples are given in this [Jupyter notebook](./usage_example.ipynb).

## Combined Dataset Columns
The combined dataset provides the following columns for each ISO (the 3 letter ISO country code) and DATE.

Note that in this table a "Y" in "Is Daily" indicates that value comes from a time series for every day. "N" indicates that the value is country-level and is the same for all dates for a country.
