# DELVE COVID19 Dataset Access

This repository provides a data set for COVID19 research consolidated from multiple sources. The dataset is available as CSV which can be loaded into most environments.

## Reading the dataset
Download the CSV from the [Dataset](https://github.com/rs-delve/covid19_datasets/tree/master/dataset) directory and load it in your favourite analysis tool. 

In Python you can load the CSV directly using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):
```python
import pandas as pd
data_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rs-delve/covid19_datasets/master/dataset/combined_dataset_latest.csv')
```

## Examples
We provide two Jupyter notebook examples:
- [Basic exploratory data analysis of the combined international dataset](./Data_Exploration.ipynb)
- [Usage of the underlying datasets](./usage_example.ipynb).

## Combined Dataset Columns
The combined dataset provides the following columns for each ISO (the 3 letter ISO country code) and DATE.

Note that in this table a "Y" in "Is Daily" indicates that value comes from a time series for every day. "N" indicates that the value is country-level and is the same for all dates for a country.
